Welcome to my first repository! This is an assignment for the Data Science Meetings organised by the Next Immune 2 (NI2) Doctoral Training Unit. Wish me luck.

ABOUT ME:
I am part of the Immunopharmacology and Interactomics Group at LIH. I grew up in Palma de Mallorca, Spain, and moved to Barcelona to pursue my Bachelor's in Biotechnology at the Universitat de Barcelona. Thanks to the EUR G.E.N.E. fellowship, I had the opportunity to carry out my Master's in Genetics at the Université Paris Cité. Now, I am pursuing my PhD, aspiring to make meaningful contributions to research.
